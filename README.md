# hello-world
A sandbox repo

Gonna write a tic-tac-toe script to exercise what I learned in Python, and test how to work with git along the way.

Goals:
1) Make the most basic code using only basic Python and printing the game on the terminal window.
2) Adding basic check that no overlappings happen.
3) Making it open, write and edit the game into a text file.
4) Changing the code to use matplotlib module.
